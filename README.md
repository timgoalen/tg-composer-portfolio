**TIM GOALEN *composer*** is a portfolio website for myself that showcases my work as a TV composer. The goal of this website is to provide a place where:
1. TV professionals (directors, producers and production managers) can find my credits, listen to my work and contact me easily.
2. Audience members can listen to music from programmes theyâ€™ve seen and get in touch.

## Design
The design is based on an original prototype that I previously built using Squarespace.

[View the prototype Squarespace site here](https://www.timgoalen.com)

Reasons for needing update (RE-WRITE)...INCL. cheaper to maintain; improve site accesibility/performance; future more maintainable/updatable.

Changed from multi-page design in the prototype, to single-page design, with sections linked in the navigation to...(explanation)
- higher lighhouse scores
- better accesibility
- improved colout schee and use ineractions (hover effects, transitions etc.)
- decided against a stand-alone landing page, instead having the 'About' section at the top of the page. to imrpove UX by taking the user directly to content [[***re-edit all this]]

### Colour Scheme

The site has a contemporary mimimalist aesthetic, based on a monochrome colour palette of white and black, with red and blue accent colours being used sparingly.

![Image of the colour palette](documentation/colour-palette.png)

### Typography
The site uses a single font - 'Poppins' - with the browser-default sans serif as a fallback in case tyhe main font fails to load correctly. Poppins is a contemporary font that fit the mimimalist aesthetic by it by it's design being based on pure geometry.

The oversized section titles use the thin 100-weight version of the font, with a responsive font-size of
`calc(4rem + 0.5vw)`.

Similar responsive font-sizes are also used for the logo, navbar links and 'About' section paragraph text.

Google Fonts was used to import the font at the top of the linked CSS file.

### Imagery

Site imagery consists of a profile headshot at the top of the page and the project promotional images in the 'Credits' section.

## Features

(!!RE-WORD!!)Mobile-first approach, using responsive units (%, vh and vw) wherever possible, to keep media queries to a minimum.

### Navigation Bar
![Image of the navigation bar](documentation/desktop-navbar.png)

- A fixed navigation bar is available on every page. 
- Clicking a link takes the user to the desired page section with a smooth-scroll effect, and triggers an opacity transition in the selected section, via a `:target` pseudo-class selector.
- The text turns blue as the cursor hovers over it, and remains blue after being clicked to indicate the users current position within the page.

### Mobile Navigation Menu
![Image of the mobile navigation menu](documentation/mobile-nav-menu.png)

- On mobile screens the navigation is displayed as an expandable menu via a hamburger icon.
- Once a destination is clicked the menu collapses.

### About
![Image of the about section](documentation/about-section.png)

- Diplayed as one column on mobile screens and two columns on tablet screens and larger.
- Features a headshot and two paragraphs detailing work highlights.

### Listen
![Image of the listen section](documentation/listen-section.png)

- A seven-track audio showreel, made with HTML `<audio>` elements.
- JavaScript is used to pause the currently playing audio element if another is played, which is crucial for good UX.

### Credits
![Image of the credits section](documentation/credits-section.png)

- List of selected credits, with official photos, programme title, production company, runtime and broadcaster information.
- Single-column layout on mobile devices and two columns on desktop screens.
### Contact & Footer
![Image of the contact section with footer](documentation/contact-section.png)

- Includes a contact form, with input validation on all fields.
- The footer includes links to my Spotify, Twitter and IMDb pages.

### Message Received Page
![Image of the message received page](documentation/message-received-page.png)

### 404 Error Page
![Image of the 404 error page](documentation/error-404-page.png)

- A custom page if the user tries to navigate to a page URL tha doesn't exist or can't be found within the site.

## Testing

Syntax errors were tested for with W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator. No errors were found.

-   [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org) - [Results](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Ftimgoalen.github.io%2Ftg-composer-portfolio%2Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)
***RUN THIS AGAIN - 'controlslist' errors shown on audio elements
-   [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) - [Results](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Ftimgoalen.github.io%2Ftg-composer-portfolio%2Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

after the first W3C markup validator test i removed the `controlslist` attribute on the `<audio>` elements, as is an experimental attribute and would fail the test. had it for `nodownload` and `noplaybackrate`, for diabling the controls for downloading the audio file and changing the playback speed. In future I will build a custom audio player for the site using JavaScript, to include this functionality.
