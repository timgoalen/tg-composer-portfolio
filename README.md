# Tim Goalen - Composer Website

[View the live project here](https://timgoalen.github.io/tg-composer-portfolio)

**TIM GOALEN *composer*** is a portfolio website for myself that showcases my work as a TV composer. The goal of this website is to provide a place where:
1. TV professionals (directors, producers and production managers) can find my credits, listen to my work and contact me easily.
2. Audience members can listen to music from programmes theyâ€™ve seen and get in touch.

## Design
The design is based on an original prototype that I previously built using Squarespace.

[View the prototype Squarespace site here](https://www.timgoalen.com)

Reasons for needing update (RE-WRITE)...INCL. cheaper to maintain; improve site accesibility/performance; future more maintainable/updatable.

Changed from multi-page design in the prototype, to single-page design, with sections linked in the navigation to...(explanation)
- higher lighhouse scores
- better accesibility
- improved colout schee and use ineractions (hover effects, transitions etc.)
- decided against a stand-alone landing page, instead having the 'About' section at the top of the page. to imrpove UX by taking the user directly to content [[***re-edit all this]]

### Colour Scheme

The site has a contemporary mimimalist aesthetic, based on a monochrome colour palette of white and black, with red and blue accent colours being used sparingly.

![Image of the colour palette](documentation/colour-palette.png)

### Typography
The site uses a single font - 'Poppins' - with the browser-default sans serif as a fallback in case tyhe main font fails to load correctly. Poppins is a contemporary font that fit the mimimalist aesthetic by it by it's design being based on pure geometry.

The oversized section titles use the thin 100-weight version of the font, with a responsive font-size of:
`calc(4rem + 0.5vw)`

A similar responsive font-size is also used for logo, navbar links and 'About' section paragraph text.

### Imagery
~~Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.~~

## Features

Mobile-first approach, using responsive units (%, vh and vw) wherever possible, to keep media queries to a minimum.

### Navigation Bar
![Image of the navigation bar](documentation/desktop-navbar.png)

- A fixed navigation bar is available on every page. 
- Clicking a link takes the user to the desired page section with a smooth scroll effect, and triggers an opacity transition in the selected section, via a `:target` pseudo-class selector.
- The text turns blue as the cursor hovers over it, and remains blue after being clicked to indicate the users current position within the page.

### Mobile Navigation Menu
![Image of the mobile navigation menu](documentation/mobile-nav-menu.png)

- On mobile screens the navigation is displayed as an expandable menu via a hamburger icon.
- Once a destination is clicked the menu collapses.

### About
![Image of the about section](documentation/about-section.png)

- Diplayed as one column on mobile screens and two columns on tablet screens and larger.
- Features a headshot and two paragraphs detailing work highlights.

### Listen
![Image of the listen section](documentation/listen-section.png)

- A seven-track audio showreel, made with HTML `<audio>` elements.
- Importantly for UX, JavaScript is used to pause the currently playing audio element if another is played.


### Credits
![Image of the credits section](documentation/credits-section.png)

- List of selected credits, with official photos, programme title, production company, runtime and broadcaster information.
- Single-column layout on mobile devices and two columns on desktop screens.

## Testing

Syntax errors were tested for with W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator. No errors were found.

-   [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org) - [Results](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Ftimgoalen.github.io%2Ftg-composer-portfolio%2Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)
***RUN THIS AGAIN - 'controlslist' errors shown on audio elements
-   [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) - [Results](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Ftimgoalen.github.io%2Ftg-composer-portfolio%2Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

after the first W3C markup validator test i removed the `controlslist` attribute on the `<audio>` elements, as is an experimental attribute and would fail the test. had it for `nodownload` and `noplaybackrate`, for diabling the controls for downloading the audio file and changing the playback speed. In future I will build a custom audio player for the site using JavaScript, to include this functionality.

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
    - Alternatively Click [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/) for a GIF demonstrating the process starting from Step 2.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://github.com) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
